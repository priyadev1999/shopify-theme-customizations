# Shopify Theme Customizations

## Feature: Color-Linked Products (Separate Products) (Metafield Based)

This feature allows products of the same type but different colors—created as separate Shopify products—to be displayed together on the product page like color variants.

> This approach is commonly used when inventory, pricing, or SKUs need to be managed per color.

### How it works
- Products are linked using a product metafield
- Each product represents a different color
- Theme renders linked products as color swatches
- Clicking a swatch navigates to the selected product 

### Theme
- Horizon (Shopify)

### Notes
This repository contains ONLY custom blocks, and assets created by me.

The custom block is designed to be integrated within the product information section (e.g., the main product details block) of the Horizon theme.  
A screenshot is included to show how the block is connected inside the theme editor.

Base theme files and proprietary Shopify assets are NOT included.
